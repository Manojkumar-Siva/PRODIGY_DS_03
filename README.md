# PRODIGY_DS_03

## Objective:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Algorithm:

### Step1:
Load and explore the dataset.
### Step2:
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and splitting into features and target.
### Step3:
Train the decision tree classifier on the training set.
### Step4:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
### Step5:
Visualize the decision tree and feature importance.
### Step6:
Interpret the results to gain insights into which features are most important in predicting customer purchases.
