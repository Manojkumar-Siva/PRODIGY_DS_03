# PRODIGY_DS_03

## Objective:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Algorithm:

### 1:
Load and explore the dataset.
### 2:
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and splitting into features and target.
### 3:
Train the decision tree classifier on the training set.
### 4:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
### 5:
Visualize the decision tree and feature importance.
### 6:
Interpret the results to gain insights into which features are most important in predicting customer purchases.
